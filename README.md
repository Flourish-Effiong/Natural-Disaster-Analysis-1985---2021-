# Natural-Disaster-Analysis-1985---2021-
A detailed Power BI data analysis project examining the global frequency, impact, and trends of natural disasters over a 36-year period.


Project Overview
This project visualizes historical data on natural disasters to identify patterns in how different types of events (such as floods, storms, and earthquakes) affect various regions over time. By analyzing global trends from 1985 to 2021, the dashboard provides insights into disaster frequency and the resulting human and economic impacts.

Features
Temporal Trend Analysis: Visualizes the rise and fluctuation of disaster occurrences across three and a half decades.

Disaster Type Categorization: Breaks down events by category to identify which types of disasters are most prevalent globally.

Geographical Impact: Highlights regional vulnerabilities and identifies areas most frequently affected by natural catastrophes.

Human Impact Metrics: Tracks data points related to the human cost associated with these events over the analyzed timeframe.

Tech Stack
Tool: Power BI Desktop

Data Source: Historical natural disaster records (1985-2021).

Techniques: Data cleaning, transformation (Power Query), and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for time-series calculations.

Natural Disaster Analysis: Key Insights
Rising Frequency: The dashboard illustrates a noticeable upward trend in the number of reported natural disasters per year from 1985 through 2021.

Geographical Hotspots: Certain regions show a much higher vulnerability to specific disaster types, such as flooding in Southeast Asia versus storm frequency in the Americas.

Human Impact vs. Occurrence: The analysis compares whether the increase in disaster frequency correlates directly with higher mortality rates or if better infrastructure has mitigated the human cost over time.
